Certainly! Let’s use a detailed example with sample IP addresses to illustrate the traffic flow:

### Example Request:
**User requests: `https://myapp.example.com`**

### Traffic Flow with Sample IPs:
1. **User (Internet, e.g., `203.0.113.45`) → Load Balancer (`10.17.2.5`)**
   - The request from the **user’s IP (`203.0.113.45`)** is sent to the **Load Balancer’s public IP (`10.17.2.5`)** located in the **public subnet (`10.17.2.0/24`)**.

2. **Load Balancer (`10.17.2.5`) → Kubernetes Node (`10.17.1.10`) in Private Subnet**
   - The Load Balancer forwards the request to a **Kubernetes worker node** with an IP of **`10.17.1.10`**, which is in the **private subnet (`10.17.1.0/24`)**.
   - Here, the traffic's **source IP (`203.0.113.45`)** is maintained, but the Load Balancer handles the routing.

3. **Kubernetes Node (`10.17.1.10`) → Kubernetes Service (ClusterIP, `10.96.0.10`)**
   - The **Kubernetes Service** (with ClusterIP `10.96.0.10`) receives the request on **node `10.17.1.10`**.
   - This Service directs the request based on its configuration, forwarding it to the correct **Ingress controller**.

4. **Ingress Controller (`10.17.1.15`) → Application Pod (`10.17.1.20`)**
   - The **Ingress controller** running on **`10.17.1.15`** processes the request and forwards it to the **application Pod** on **`10.17.1.20`**.
   - At this point, the traffic is now routed to the exact container running your application.

5. **Application Pod (`10.17.1.20`) → Response Back to Ingress Controller (`10.17.1.15`)**
   - The application container processes the request and sends a response back to the **Ingress controller** at **`10.17.1.15`**.

6. **Ingress Controller (`10.17.1.15`) → Kubernetes Service (`10.96.0.10`) → Load Balancer (`10.17.2.5`)**
   - The **Ingress controller** sends the response back through the **Kubernetes Service** (`10.96.0.10`).
   - The response is then forwarded to the **Load Balancer** at **`10.17.2.5`**.

7. **Load Balancer (`10.17.2.5`) → User (Internet, `203.0.113.45`)**
   - The **Load Balancer** sends the final response back to the **user’s IP (`203.0.113.45`)** over the internet.

### Summary:
1. **User (`203.0.113.45`) → Load Balancer (`10.17.2.5`)**
2. **Load Balancer (`10.17.2.5`) → Kubernetes Node (`10.17.1.10`)**
3. **Kubernetes Node (`10.17.1.10`) → Kubernetes Service (`10.96.0.10`)**
4. **Ingress Controller (`10.17.1.15`) → Application Pod (`10.17.1.20`)**
5. **Pod (`10.17.1.20`) → Ingress Controller (`10.17.1.15`) → Service (`10.96.0.10`)**
6. **Load Balancer (`10.17.2.5`) → User (`203.0.113.45`)**

**Important Note:**
- The **Load Balancer handles the routing** between the public and private subnets.
- Traffic that comes in from **`0.0.0.0/0` (the internet)** is routed to **private IPs (`10.17.1.0/24`)** through the Load Balancer configured in the **public subnet (`10.17.2.0/24`)**.
- **Security rules must allow traffic** from the Load Balancer to the private subnet IPs to make this flow possible.

This example should give you a clear picture of how the request routes through the infrastructure to reach your application container.
